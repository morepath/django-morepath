* Make morepath work with a Django request + path.

* Make morepath respond with a Django response, possibly a subclass ala
  DRF.

Use django-wsgi


Dependencies on request:

We can solve this by using django-wsgi and then convincing it to use
Morepath's subclass.

* app.py


  request.application_url

  request.view_name - Morepath specific.

  request.method

  request.GET - get parameters

  request.app - Morepath specific

  request.unconsumed - Morepath specific

  request.clear_after() - Morepath specific.

  request.host - in standard morepath tween.

  request.view - Morepath API

  request.link - Morepath API

  request.class_link - Morepath API

  request.child - Morepath API

  request.after - Morepath API

  request.path_code_info - what does this do?

  request.view_code_info

  request.identity

  request._run_after

Response - our usage actually appears API compatible to the Django Response.

Still, would like to use the webob response directly and turn this into
Django response somehow.

Questions:

* Does this work well if this application is mounted in a larger
  application? Needs tests.
